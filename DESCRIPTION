Description: This package organizes the functions used in cleaning and aggregating the data submitted by our dock managers in the daily discharge report. The functions can largely be broken into 2 buckets: those that handle the initilization and management of the SQLITE db, and those that handle the extraction, cleaning, and loading of the data from the dock managers' reports.
